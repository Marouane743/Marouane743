-  Hi, I’m @Marouane743
  I'm a data science and computer engineering student passionate about using technology to solve complex problems. I'm currently studying at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne.
-  I’m interested in  Machine learning, software development, and simulation of granular flows.
-  I’m currently learning Advanced neural network techniques and GPU parallelization for optimized computations.
- Image Processing with Python :
Created an algorithm to extract features from skin lesion images, training a classifier with a neural network.
- Orbital Sonification Project : 
Developed a 3D audio engine to sonify and spatialize orbital trajectories of Earth, Mars, and Venus.
